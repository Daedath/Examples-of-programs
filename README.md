PolygonsSave.txt, Reactangles_save.txt, STL-fixed-operator(==).txt  -  these codes are all concerned with realization of class. 
For example in 1 & 2 pragramm we are given a few members of the class, those being geometrical objects. 
If they overlap the result is another member of the class, a new object with coordinates.

Recursion.txt - is concerned with finding a max element of a set via recursion algorithm.
